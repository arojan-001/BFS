#Breadth-First Search Algorithm
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph or tree in breadthward motion. It starts at a designated node (often called the "root" in a tree or the "source" in a graph) and explores all of its neighbors at the current level before moving on to the next level of neighbors. BFS is typically used to search for a specific node or to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.![image](https://github.com/arojan-001/BFS/assets/61918182/a555dadb-d636-45a2-986e-c632d909ff39)
